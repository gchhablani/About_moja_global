- [Gcbm - UI Project](https://github.com/moja-global/mentorship/blob/main/google-summer-of-code/GSOC-2022-Ideas.md)
        -  GCBM is built on top of flint. It is an important
        -  We want FLINT-UI for people from non-programming backgrounds to be able to use the FLINT.
        - PointC and RothC are simpler and will help a person get a hold on the codebase, GCBM is complex. It's like diving into a shallow pool before a deep pool.
        - GCBM has 10 building blocks, and a person should be able to experiment with those building blocks.
            - Currently we are only giving the user three steps and we constrain it.
            - By the end of the project we want to provide a way to experiment with all the 10 building blocks.
        - Visualization of the model - input files.
        - We want to bring everything from the GCBM Standalone project to FLINT-UI. See this [message](https://mojaglobal.slack.com/archives/C010Z37GL2U/p1645086514631459).

- Why Ant-Design instead of tail-wind? See this [discussion](https://github.com/moja-global/FLINT-UI/discussions/173).
    - Reproducible Components
        - Ant-Design allows us to use same components throughout the UI.
        - We will use pre-build designs eventually with some modifications.
    - Customization
        - More customization is possible in Ant-Design.
