# 19-02-2022 UI Working Group weekly meeting 

## Discussion

- A brief introduction to moja global and FLINT
- Talked about what’s a working group and gave an introduction to the UI working group.
- In the user interface working group we are going for a more sprint-like and focusing on one project at a time rather than multiple.
- For the upcoming 5 weeks we’ll be working towards building the ‘TSC working group notice board’
- In this week i.e 19th Feb to 25th Feb we would like to do some ‘Research’ and come to the following conclusions:
    - Tech stack to use.
    - Content we need to put.
    - Do we need a better looking page instead of it looking static one?
- Roles one can have for the TSC working group notice board asre - content-writing/Documentation. Help impllemening the UI, Voulenteering to take the meeting notes, and other non code contributions
