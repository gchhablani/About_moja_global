## Discussion
- LFX Mentorship: https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/d70e1f9e-abde-403f-8389-52a122301500
- GCBM Simulator
    - Two repos to look into:
        - FLINT-UI: https://github.com/moja-global/FLINT-UI
        - FLINT-Cloud: https://github.com/moja-global/FLINT.Cloud
- FLINT:
    - GCBM
        - User has to build a bridge/roof of the house.
        - FLINT-Cloud does not provide that.
        - We want to run on enormous amounts of data, not let users download and run on things locally.
- Look up GCBM Standalone Project, GCBM FLINT-UI, and GCBM Demo Run.
- Compare GCBM FLINT-UI vs. GCBM Demo Run
- Issues - Change in code does not reflect locally.
    - Docker-compose up - Only built project is shown locally.
    - Footer is displayed differently based on the OS - 4 columns vs 1 column - due to Docker.
    - Solution: Build again and run docker compose up.
- How to tackle stale issues?
    - Person who is creating issue will usually know expected time.
    - Give contributor a buffer time to complete the task.
    - Can also set up a GitHub Action.
- UI Design:
    - Rough idea on WireFrame: https://wireframe.cc/rLPTTX
    - Figma Designs for RothC/PointC.
